### How to Engage with this Course
At this point in your dbt learning journey, you likely have either:
1. Followed some of the earlier coursework including dbt Fundamentals OR
2. You have your own dbt project that you are using for your organization.

#### Using Practice Exercises
We will provide practice exercises that can be applied to the dbt Fundamentals coursework after you have completed the course. If you are bringing your own dbt Cloud account, you can transfer the practice exercises to your own project. If you are not using dbt Cloud, there are principles throughout the course that you will be able to apply as well, though you won't have access to the dbt Cloud interface and infrastructure.

If you don't have your code from dbt fundamentals, the initial underlying code that we are using in this course can be found in this repository: [https://github.com/coapacetic/learn-on-demand](https://github.com/coapacetic/learn-on-demand)

Feel free to join us in #learn-on-demand in dbt Slack as you learn.
