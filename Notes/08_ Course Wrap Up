## 08_ Course Wrap Up

### Congratulations!
Thank you for joining all of us from the dbt Labs team!!! At this point, you have been empowered with the fundamentals of dbt - models, sources, tests, docs, and deployment.  

Make sure you hit complete on each of the lessons (including this one!) and pass all of the Checks for Understanding to mark the course as complete and receive your dbt Fundamentals badge. When you mark all lessons complete, it may take a few seconds for your badge to be created.

Check out the resources below to continue the journey, stay fresh on your skills, and share this with your fellow analytics engineers.

#### Resources

**dbt Docs**: There is no shame in referencing the docs as an analytics engineer! Use this to continue your journey, copy YML code into your project, or figure out more advanced features.

**Short courses**: We have four courses to continue leveling up:
- **Jinja, Macros, and Packages**: Extend dbt with Jinja/Macros and import packages to speed up modeling and leverage existing macros.
- **Advanced Materializations**: So far you have learned about tables and views. This course will teach you about ephemeral models, incremental models, and snapshots.
- **Analyses and Seeds**: Analyses can be used for ad hoc queries in your dbt project and seeds are for importing CSVs into your warehouse with dbt.
- **Refactoring SQL for Modularity**: Migrating code from a previous tool to dbt? Learn how to migrate legacy code into dbt with modularity in mind.
